This is the APK model to be used for testing.

Basically, you can extract the zip "app.target.zip" and compile on Android Studio (selecting the "unsigned" build variant set on it's graddle build commands) and you'll get the same "app.target.apk" (already here).

This app has a main activity with a TextView, it basically does nothing, but has a INI file (to later be altered as well) and all the basic resources resulting in a compile APK that was supposed to run on android, if properly signed.
